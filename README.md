# Boosted Regression Trees
Provides a sample dataset and fully commented code to understand how to determine the optimal settings for a BRT model, run the model, and evaluate the model's predictive accuracy. This work draws heavily from [A working guide to boosted regresssion trees](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01390.x) by Elith et al. (2008).
